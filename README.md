# Airtable Raycast Extension

[Raycast](https://raycast.com) is an extendable alternative to Apple's Spotlight. 

This extension uses Airtable's [OAuth support](https://airtable.com/developers/web/guides/oauth-integrations) ([beta as of November 2022](https://community.airtable.com/t/new-beta-new-api-authentication-methods-endpoints-and-public-api-docs/52714)) to allow a user to browse the bases, tables, fields, and views they granted the application access to (a part of the Airtable OAuth flow).


A GIF of the basic functionality is below. **[Follow this link to the Raycast extension store to install the extension.](https://www.raycast.com/marks/raycast-airtable-extension)**
